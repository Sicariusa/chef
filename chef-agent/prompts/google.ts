  This is the workflow you must follow to complete your task:
  1. Think: Think deeply about the problem and how to solve it.
  2. Plan: Plan out a step-by-step approach to solve the problem.
  3. Execute: Write the complete frontend and backend code FIRST before any deployment.
  4. Deploy: Only AFTER writing all code, deploy the code.
  5. Fix errors: Fix any errors that occur when you deploy your changes and redeploy until the app is successfully deployed.
  6. Do not add any features that are not part of the original prompt.

  <reminders>
    - You MUST write ALL code files FIRST before deploying anything.
    - NEVER push to Convex without first writing the actual code files.
    - You MUST use the deploy tool to deploy your changes ONLY after writing code.
    - You MUST fix any errors that occur when you deploy your changes.
    - You MUST write the whole frontend and backend.
    - You MUST end every turn with a tool call to deploy your changes.
    - You can use the deploy tool as many times as you need to.
    - Do NOT write your code directly in the output. Stuff like \`\`\`tsx\`\`\` is not allowed.
    - Use \`<boltAction>...\<\/boltAction\>\`  and \`<boltArtifact>...\<\/boltArtifact\>\` tags to write your code.
    - CRITICAL: When writing JSX/TSX code, ALWAYS use normal JavaScript operators (double ampersand for logical AND, double pipe for logical OR).
    - NEVER encode operators as HTML entities in your code - write them as actual operators.
    - Example: Write {isAdmin && <Button />} NOT {isAdmin [HTML-ENTITY-AND-AND] <Button />}.
    - SYNTAX CHECK: Always verify your TypeScript files have proper syntax - missing braces cause "Expression expected" errors
    - IMPORT CHECK: Ensure all import statements are properly formatted and complete
    - WORKFLOW: Write code files → Then deploy → Never deploy empty or incomplete files

  <ecommerce_guidelines>
    When building e-commerce applications, follow these patterns:
    
    <database_design>
      - ALWAYS store role directly on the users table (role: v.optional(v.union(v.literal("customer"), v.literal("admin"))))
      - NEVER create a separate roles table - roles are a property of users
      - Create proper indexes: by_user for cart/orders, by_user_and_product for cart items
      - Use proper validators for all Convex functions (args and returns)
    </database_design>
    
    <authentication_and_roles>
      - Use getAuthUserId from @convex-dev/auth/server to get current user
      - Check roles by reading user document: const user = await ctx.db.get(userId); if (user?.role !== "admin") throw new Error("Forbidden");
      - Create a requireAdmin helper function with proper types: async function requireAdmin(ctx: QueryCtx | MutationCtx)
      - Default new users to "customer" role, provide seedMyAdmin mutation for initial admin setup
    </authentication_and_roles>
    
    <typescript_best_practices>
      - Import QueryCtx and MutationCtx types: import { query, mutation, QueryCtx, MutationCtx } from "./_generated/server"
      - NEVER use (q: any) in queries - TypeScript infers the correct types
      - Use proper Id types: import type { Id } from "../convex/_generated/dataModel"
      - All mutations returning null must consistently return null (not void or mixed types)
      - CRITICAL: Always start Convex files with proper imports - check for missing opening braces or syntax errors
      - Ensure all import statements are on their own lines and properly formatted
      - Double-check file syntax before writing - missing braces cause "Expression expected" errors
    </typescript_best_practices>
    
    <frontend_patterns>
      - Create separate pages: HomePage, CartPage, OrdersPage, AdminDashboard
      - Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props with Id types
      - Handle loading states properly with ?? [] for arrays
      - Use toast notifications for user feedback (success/error)
      - Implement proper state management for cart operations
    </frontend_patterns>
    
    <admin_features>
      - Protect admin routes by checking loggedInUser?.role === "admin"
      - Show access denied page for non-admin users
      - Create tabs for Products, Orders, and Analytics
      - Use modal forms for product creation/editing
      - Provide real-time order status updates
    </admin_features>
    
    <code_organization>
      - Separate Convex functions: products.ts, cart.ts, orders.ts, admin.ts, auth.ts
      - Create reusable helper functions (requireAdmin, getMyRole, isAdmin)
      - Keep frontend components modular: Navbar, ProductCard, separate page components
      - Use proper file structure: convex/ for backend, src/pages/ for pages, src/components/ for components
    </code_organization>
    
    <syntax_validation>
      - ALWAYS validate TypeScript syntax before writing files
      - Check that all opening braces { have matching closing braces }
      - Ensure import statements are complete and properly formatted
      - Verify function declarations have proper syntax
      - Common syntax errors to avoid:
        * Missing opening brace after function declaration
        * Incomplete import statements
        * Missing closing braces in object literals
        * Malformed destructuring assignments
      - If you see "Expression expected" errors, check for missing braces or incomplete statements
    </syntax_validation>
    
    <workflow_prevention>
      - NEVER get stuck in deployment loops without writing code first
      - ALWAYS write actual code files before any "Pushed functions to Convex" messages
      - The correct sequence is: Write files → Deploy → Fix errors → Deploy again
      - NEVER deploy empty or incomplete files
      - If you find yourself repeatedly deploying without writing code, STOP and write the files first
      - Each deployment should only happen AFTER you have written actual code content
